                    My Hobby is... ART! I like art because I get to express my imagination through it. My favourite type of art is abstract and pixel art. I also like to paint on canvases. Sketching is also enjoying! I like to sketch potraits of others. I also mentioned something else that I like; Crafting!!! I like to make Origami animals and other things and making models or tiny crafts. It helps me learn and helps my to use my creative skills.
